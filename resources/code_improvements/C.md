To improve the code to modern C, we can make several changes to adopt modern C features and coding practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use `stdbool.h`: Instead of defining the `enum TrueFalse` for Boolean values, we can use the `stdbool.h` header to use the standard `bool` type. This makes the code more readable and in line with modern C.

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

typedef bool boolean;
```

2. Use fixed-width integer types: Instead of using `int` for all integer types, we can use fixed-width integer types like `int32_t` from `stdint.h`. This ensures consistency and platform independence.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

typedef int32_t int32;
typedef int16_t int16;
typedef int8_t int8;
```

3. Use modern functions for random number generation: Instead of using `rand()` and `srand()` from the standard library, it's better to use the more modern and better random number generator functions provided by `random.h`.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int32_t Random(int32_t Hi) {
    return (rand() % Hi);
}

void InitializeRandomSeed() {
    srand(time(NULL));
}
```

4. Avoid global variables: Global variables make the code less maintainable and harder to reason about. Instead, pass variables as function arguments and return values as needed.

5. Use meaningful names and comments: Improve variable and function names to be more descriptive and add comments to explain the purpose of functions and important blocks of code.

6. Separate the game logic from the user interface: Separate the game logic and the user interface into different functions. This makes the code more modular and easier to read.

7. Use `snprintf` instead of `strcpy`: To avoid buffer overflow issues, prefer using `snprintf` to copy strings to character arrays.

8. Avoid using `atoi`: Instead of using `atoi` to convert strings to integers, use `strtol` for better error handling.

9. Use `fgets` and handle input correctly: Use `fgets` for user input to avoid buffer overflow and handle user input correctly to handle invalid input gracefully.

10. Use `stdbool.h` and C99: Make sure to use the C99 standard and include the appropriate headers for the functions used.

11. Check for memory allocation errors: When using dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `malloc`), always check for memory allocation errors.

These are just some general suggestions. The full code improvement process would require a deeper understanding of the code's functionality and design, as well as addressing specific areas for improvement.
